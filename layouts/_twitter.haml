  When I'm not composing sprawling, pithy blog posts, I like
  to write the occasional tweet. Twitter is one of those things
  that became surprisingly essential to me. Who needs news?
  Who need journalism? I've got 140 characters!

  See what I've written:
  %a{ :href => "http://www.twitter.com/alexvollmer" }
    %img{ :src => "http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/follow_bird-c.png", :alt => "Follow alexvollmer on Twitter" }
