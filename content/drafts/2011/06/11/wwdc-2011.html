<p>After returning home in the after-glow (read: bleary-eyed) of the 2011 edition of WWDC, I think I finally have a moment to reflect on the conference and the slew of goodies we found under the Christmas tree Monday morning.</p>
<h1>Monday Keynote</h1>
<p>Officially, the content in the Monday keynote is all anyone at WWDC is really supposed to talk about publicly. Frankly, the details within the rest of the conference are (mostly) an elaboration of what is announced publicly in the Monday-morning keynote address. There are few little geeky odds-and-ends that would be fun to write about, but I'll wait until they're publicly available. But those aren't the big things, these are:</p>
<h2>Lion</h2>
<p>I don't do enough Mac development (yet) to warrant playing with betas of the OS. I need the OS to be stable so that I can get my iOS work done. That said, I was starting to develop "Lion-envy" whenever I saw other geeks trying it out. This morning I finally sacrificed my laptop to a Lion install just so I could get the new bits. In just the first few minutes I realized this is a really nice upgrade from Snow Leopard. I can't wait for the official release so I can upgrade my main work machine.</p>
<p>When Lion was first announced I wondered if it was going to continue the "flattening-out" in the curve of feature-growth that we saw from Leopard to Snow Leopard. Honestly, I had a hard time imagining what they could do to evolve such a mature OS. But once again, the folks in Cupertino wowed me with some innovative thinking about how to make the OS easier to use. Goodbye Spaces, goodbye Exposé, hello Mission Control and Launch Pad. These seem to be a much better implementation of the ideas behind those original technologies. But I don't know that they would have been the obvious conclusion pre-iOS. It's hard to overstate the impact iOS has had on Apple's thinking about UI design.</p>
<p>I like the muted look of Lion. The Finder is just a wee-bit more toned-down. Standard Aqua buttons have dropped much of their original garish look. Overall it's just a much more mature look. There's just a lot of polish in this release. Features like Air Drop, Resume, Auto Save, Versions do a nice job of just rounding the sharp-edges off. With these features, it's clear that Apple has declared war on the filesystem as a core concept for personal computing.</p>
<h2>iOS 5</h2>
<p>If there was a sub-theme below iCloud, it was (dare I say?) a bit of humility from Apple for acknowledging the things that needed to be addressed in all the platforms. The thunder of applause that went up when the new notifications UI was announced from iOS showed just how frustrated we had all become with a system that clearly wasn't working. It's one of the few times I've seen Apple acknowledge the superiority of someone else's design and just unabashedly copied it. The new notifications system was clearly inspired by Android and Android deserves a lot of credit for getting that right the first time. Kudos to the Google-Bot.</p>
<p>PC Free was probably received the second warmest welcome from the audience. It was great to hear Apple openly acknowledge the thud-of-a-user-experience we all had when we got our shiny new iPad or iPhone and were faced with the "please plug me into iTunes" screen. Cue the sad trumpet song. The original promise of the iPad as a replacement for a traditional computer is now actually possible.</p>
<p>The two things that surprised me the most were the addition of the Reminders app and the deep Twitter integration. As someone who has worked on a <a href="http://www.busymac.com/busytodo/index.html">MobileMe-based to-do list app</a>, I can't say that I didn't feel my heart sink a bit when this was announced. But this was one of those apps that had many wondering why it took this long for Apple to build it. I haven't played with it yet, but I'm really curious to see how the location-awareness features work.</p>
<p>Even more intriguing is the first-class Twitter integration in the iOS. Without tipping too much about what's in the API, I can say that it's more than just a cursory implementation. I can only hope that it means that other big services will join up soon and all of us poor developers can stop dealing with the home-grown contraptions we're using now to talk to these services.</p>
<h2>iCloud</h2>
<p>iCloud was clearly the center-piece of the show. If Apple pulls this off, it has the potential to radically change the personal computing experience. We all have plenty of reason to be suspicious of this offering. MobileMe is Exhibit A in the case against Apple doing online services. But I think it's also fair to remember the services that Apple has gotten right, specifically iTunes and iOS Push Notifications. I remain cautiously optimistic about this. More than anything else announced last week, I think this is the feature that could have the biggest lasting effect.</p>
<p>What makes iCloud so compelling is the chance to take advantage of server-side storage without the penalty of explicit synchronization. Frankly, it's what makes Dropbox so great too. As the tag-line goes, "it just works". But something like Dropbox doesn't quite make sense in iOS where the holy-war on filesystems was declared from day one. Instead, iCloud is a re-thinking of the atomic units of documents in such a way that its constraints promise a tighter integration between devices. The slide in the keynote in which Jobs declared that they were "demoting" the Mac says it all. Out of all the technologies introduced this year, iCloud captures my imagination the most. I can't wait to see what people build on top of it.</p>
<h1>The Rest</h1>
<p>I've done my fair share of conferences and WWDC has become the one I've enjoyed the most. RailsConf is probably my second favorite, but I have to admit that I've always felt a little miffed that they moved it from Portland.  WWDC is a sensory-overload the likes of which I've never experienced for a geek conference. This year, especially, just felt huge and somewhat overwhelming. Maybe it was the announcements on Monday, maybe it was the crush of humanity trying to move through Moscone, maybe it was just the buzz in the air. This year's conference was my favorite of the three WWDCs I've been to.</p>
<p>There was a lot of great stuff in the sessions that I'll eventually write about once it's all publicly released. There's so much goodness just in the developer-side of iOS that I'm seriously considering just writing for that and waiting for the fall release of the OS. It was a truly inspiring week. Once I shake off the sleep-deprivation I, like many others I talked to, will be back to work with a vengeance.</p>
<p>A large part of what made the 2011 edition so fantastic was getting a lot out of the extra-curricular hours outside of the conference. Lots of late nights talking with other Apple-nerds is a great way to really cement a sense of place in the community. My only regret is that there were still several folks I didn't get a chance to introduce myself to and chat with.</p>
<p>Well, it's time to get back to "real life". I have a lawn to mow and family to spend time with. But starting Monday, I'll be hitting Xcode in a caffeine-fueled rage, ready to kick some tater.</p>
