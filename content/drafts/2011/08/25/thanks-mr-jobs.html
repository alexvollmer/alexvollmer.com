<p>I suppose it's quite fashionable at the moment to comment on the Steve Jobs' resignation as Apple's CEO. Maybe this is just another me-too post, but I felt compelled to say <em>something</em> about this moment.</p>
<p>The first computer I fell in love with was the Apple ][ (2? II?). I learned BASIC and a smidgen of assembly to write little games. I grew up with a bunch of other computer-nerd friends and we all swapped disks with games we copied (remember Copy ][ Plus?) or stuff we'd written. Only I didn't own an Apple. Instead the computer my parents chose to buy was a TRS-80. It was a good lesson in hiding your disappointment for the sake of loved ones' feelings.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to high-school and my parents upgraded us to a Mac Classic with 30MB external drive.  I had walked away from programming for a few years and turned my attention to music. I didn't program on that Mac, but I did just about everything else. That computer carried me through my college years.</p>
<p>Once I entered professional life I was in the world of Windows, DOS and PCs. I was working for a financial services company and was about as far away from programming as a person could get. When I returned to the Pacific Northwest fifteen years ago, I found myself back in the world of computers.</p>
<p>My professional career in computers really started with UNIX and Linux. I was a pretty hard-core Linux guy for a long time, until the day I finally ran out of patience with all the fiddly configuration. I bought my first modern Mac five years ago and started learning to develop on the platform three years ago.</p>
<p>The timing of my "conversion" to the Apple platform couldn't have come at a better time. Not only was the marketplace exploding with demand for those skills but, more importantly, Apple rescued me at a time when I was pretty disillusioned with technology.</p>
<p>While I started playing with computers at an early age, it's not my biggest passion. Computers and programming are really just a means to an end to me. It's not that I don't care about my craft, it's more that I care more about the end-product than the process to get there. Honestly I don't know how much longer I could have gone on feigning interest in algorithms and scalability. Don't get me wrong—they're important, but I'm not passionate about them.</p>
<p>When I came to the Apple platform I thought, <em>finally somebody gave a damn about the person on the other side of the glass</em> and I was happy to be a part of it. So all of this is a roundabout way of saying "thanks" to Mr. Jobs and the company and culture he helped build.</p>
