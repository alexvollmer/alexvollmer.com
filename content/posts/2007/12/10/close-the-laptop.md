I've got a million projects. My GTD list is a mile long with home and personal geek projects. But some weekends you need to just put all that aside and give yourself a play-day. I spent my Sunday bundled up watching the Seahawks wrap up their fourth consecutive NFC West title. Not a bad way to spend a day.
