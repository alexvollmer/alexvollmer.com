I have to give big kudos to the author for keeping the book focused and short. He has a pretty succint thesis to get across and doesn't pad the book unnecessarily to add weight. It's worth considering that the publisher probably printed the book on really high-quality paper to make the retail price fall in line with other professional titles. Hmmm...

There is nothing terribly earth-shattering about the contents--the cover pretty much covers it. However, I did enjoy the sections covering user-testing, especially the part about doing it on the cheap. I think the mystery of usability has created a market for boutique firms that provide these services at a premium. Once people get hip to DIY usability-testing, I would forsee a "market correction" in the future.

3 out 5 stars.
