With a little help from Ryan Davis' Hoe and reading the actual documentation of the `rubyforge` command, I finally got a gem released for my little [Camping](http://redhanded.hobix.com/bits/campingAMicroframework.html) app, [Chikkin In A Bukket](http://chikkenbukket.rubyforge.org/). Yaaayyy!

Chikkin In A Bukket is a simple, lightweight web application for accessing your Amazon S3 account. There are a lot of interfaces to S3, I hope that other people will find this one easy to use.
