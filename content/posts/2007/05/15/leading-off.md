Hi folks, and welcome to the new location of my blog. I've retired the old [feedbag blog](http://blog.feedbagnews.net The old feedbag blog) and started this one since the topics I want to write about have grown beyond the scope of working on feedbag. Working on feedbag was a great experience, but I have since started new side-projects and a fantastic new job, thereby putting feedbag on the back-burner.

I was finally motivated to setup a new blog because I'm heading off to [RailsConf 2007](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/ Official RailsConf 2007 site) and I wanted to have a clean slate to post about my experience there. This event seemed like a good time to make a break with the past and start over.

So stay tuned. I'll be heading off to RailsConf this week and I'll begin posting starting from day one.
