  :body: You know, I remember the quote as Cortez, but I looked around on the 'net and came up with Columbus instead. Here, I think you've caught me being lazy by just copying and pasting the quote. Shame on me.

<p>This quote comes from the character of Marko Ramius, as played by Sean Connery, from one of my all-time favorite films, "The Hunt for Red October". I love that quote in particular because I always think of it whenever I decide to tweak my process, my work environment or my tools. For all but the most trivial changes, you usually have to immerse yourself in it. So I usually "burn my ships" by leaving behind the old way of doing things to really burn the new way into my brain.

<p>Sometimes the new way turns out to not be so great. That's fine because that's a satisfactory result of the experiment. If the "new way" turns out to suck, there's just as much to learn (if not more) from a real crash-and-burn than success.

<p>The first big "ship-burning" I did was very early in my career. I had been a few months into my professional developer career doing Java and decided that I really liked this Unix thing. So I completely wiped out my Windows NT work box and put one of the first versions of Red Hat on there. I figured if I was going to get good at Linux I was going to have to just jump in the deep end of the pool and learn to swim.

<p>It turned out to be an absolutely wonderful decision. Throughout the years I moved through several distributions: Red Hat to Mandrake to Gentoo to Ubuntu. Each new distribution taught me something more about Linux than I knew before (especially true for Gentoo).

<p>I've done the same trick with editors too. When I first started out I used _vi_ for my Java development. I tried using the first IDEs (JBuilder, etc.) but they were all terrible. Plus, at that time a serious Java IDE for Linux was still a twinkle in Erich Gamma's eye. I had a co-worker who was an XEmacs power-user and it looked like he got a lot done so I figured I'd give it a go&#8212;especially since I had on-site technical support. This was my first experience with Emacs and I never really got beyond basic editing. I wrote a couple of macros but that was about it.

<p>Then NetBeans rolled around and I was more than happy to start using it. I had a decent intellisense feature and built-in Ant integration, both of which were a significant step forward to me. I ran with that for a couple of years until I started a new job where everyone was using this new-fangled thing called Eclipse. I tried to hold-out with NetBeans for a while, but after watching some others pull off some seriously cool tricks in Eclipse I knew it was time to give it a go. I've ridden that Eclipse horse for damn-near six years and I'd be willing to put my knowledge of Eclipse-editing arcana up against anyone.

<p>Several years laster, on the operating system front, another big change was coming. I had been a die-hard Linux fan since my switch back in the Old Days, but by winter of 2005 I had run into a tangled knot of Linux-related headaches that really sapped the fun out of it for me. Between home servers and 64-bit laptop (in 2005!) I spent more time just trying to keep my machines up to date and running than actually getting anything productive done. However, it wasn't until I went to my first Seattle Ruby Brigade meeting (when everyone there had a Mac) that I seriously considered switching operating systems.

<p>This was the same time that I discovered Ruby. What attracted me to the language was not only the beauty of the syntax, but the underlying philosophies of pragmatism, simplicity and no-bullshit attitude. There seemed to be a similar attitude in Mac users and I found this approach appealing. This is not a knock on Linux. I _love_ Linux, I just don't want to use it for my desktop OS anymore. I don't have the patience to fiddle with things that much anymore. I have lots of ideas and I'll never get anywhere if I get bogged-down with irrelevant minutiae and yak-shaving.

<p>When I switched to the Mac I got myself a license for TextMate which has definitely been the editor-of-choice for lots of Rubyists. However, [as I blogged about before](http://livollmers.net/index.php/2008/10/06/back-to-myemacs/ Back to My Emacs), it's now time to get off the TM-train and switch (back) to Emacs.

<p>So what's the point of all of this? Am I just thrashing? Am I desperately throwing myself at each and every new tool on the block? You might think so, but I actually have _some_ discriminating taste. I do try out _a lot_ of tools because I'm always looking for some kind of edge, anything that I can leverage to get stupid busy-work out of the way. As I get older I have less and less patience for this sort of thing for _productivity taxes_. I just want to get something important done.

<p>So, from time to time, a little alarm goes off inside my brain to remind me that it's time for a change. Sometimes it's something as simple as changing my terminal or editing font. Other times it's things like learning a [new](http://erlang.org/ Erlang) [language](http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/ Cocoa). Regardless, all of these things keep me from getting mentally lazy. Once I get mentally complacent, it's game over. So consider if perhaps it's time to "burn some ships" just keep things interesting.

<p>Good heavens, some day I may even do something as crazy as switch to a Dvorak keyboard layout. That just might make my head explore&#8212;in a good way.
