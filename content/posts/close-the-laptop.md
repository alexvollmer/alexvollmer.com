    Feel happy that your Seahawks have my 49ers to be the lapdogs of the NFC West. So...yeah, the Seahawks are the class of the division, but sadly that's not all that much to be proud about. 
    
    One day, the 49ers shall rise again! Of course, your daughter may be in college by then...
    
    Coming down to the Bay Area anytime soon?

    Yeah I would have to agree with your NFC West sentiments. Being called the champion of this division is the football equivalent of being damned with faint praise. 
    
    I have no doubt that the Niners will get it back together--they just need to find some new ownership. Like you've said before, it's a bleak time in Bay Area sports. Maybe this is the price of The Catch and five Super Bowl titles.
    
    Next time I'm in the Bay Area we'll have to hook up for beers. Oh yeah, I'm <i>dying</i> to check out the Computer History Museum in Mountain View. Extra nerd-points for me!

Iâ€™ve got a million projects. My GTD list is a mile long with home and personal geek projects. But some weekends you need to just put all that aside and give yourself a play-day. I spent my Sunday bundled up watching the Seahawks wrap up their fourth consecutive NFC West title. Not a bad way to spend a day.
