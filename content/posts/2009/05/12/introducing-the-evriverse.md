![graph.jpg](/images/2009/05/graph.jpg)After several months of work, I'm pleased to announce the release of Evri's EvriVerse for the iPhone. We've tried to capture the unique things we do at Evri into the awesomeness that is the iPhone. I won't spill all the details here, so check out out the "official" company [post](http://blog.evri.com/index.php/2009/05/11/welcome-to-the-evriverse-evris-iphone-app/).

I've been working on this thing for a few months, mostly on a part-time basis. We have a 20% time program at Evri where devs can pitch ideas they want to spend one day a week on. I was _dying_ to write an iPhone app and jumped at the opportunity to turn it into a 20% project. After some early prototypes I got enough attention that I was given a solid two-week sprint to finish it off.

This was a ton of fun to work on and I have five or six posts on some things I discovered while working on it. 

It's free in the [App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=312716560=8) now. We'd love to hear any feedback you may have, which you can post on the [Evri Support Page](http://blog.evri.com/index.php/iphone-application-support/).
