I am pleased to announce the release of Peepcode's latest screencast about MacRuby written by yours truly with Geoffrey Grossenbach and technical editing by Laurent Sansonetti.

Ever since I saw Laurent's and Rich Kilmer's presentations about MacRuby and HotCocoa at RubyConf '08, I've been jazzed about what MacRuby brings to the world of Cocoa development. So check out the screencast for the coolest new Ruby on the block.
