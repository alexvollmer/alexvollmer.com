<p>It has been, as they say, quiet…too quiet. While it may appear as though I've disappeared from the face of the earth, I'm still here. The second half of 2011 has been a very busy year. I've been fortunate to work with some <a href="http://busymac.com">great</a> <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nordstrom/id474349412?mt=8">clients</a> this year, but the best part has been the release of my new iOS app, <a href="http://meechuapp.com">Meechu</a>.</p>
<p>Meechu is an iOS app that bridges the gap between people you meet, and staying connected to them online. All of us have some kind of presence on the internet. The obvious candidates are popular social networks like Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn, but you may also just have a website. With Meechu, you add these to the app and then share them with others when you meet them. Like the tagline says, we want to keep the conversation going.</p>

<p>By itself, sharing isn't particularly interesting. Meechu makes it ridiculously simple to connect to someone via those shared points of presence. For example, if you meet someone that has a Twitter account and you have a Twitter account, simply tap a button to follow them. No trading business cards, or scratching stuff down on scraps of paper. Meechu also records where and when you met someone, so it's easy to review who you've met in the past.</p>

<p>Meechu currently supports sharing Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn accounts as well web sites. I have some very ambitious plans for this app and am integrating it with a number of other popular services. My goal is to make Meechu the tool of choice for bridging the gap between your real-life and your internet-life. If you have a strong opinion about what you would like to see Meechu include in the future, I would love to <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/meechuapp.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dEhtNnRUQlo5dW4wZzdyVlJiMEVfb3c6MQ">hear your feedback</a>.</p>
<p>Go check it out. Tell your friends. Let me know what you think.</p>
