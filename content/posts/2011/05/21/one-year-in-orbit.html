<p>It's been a year since I called it quits being an employee and struck out on my own. In that time I've had the privilege of working with <a href="http://www.panopto.com/">some</a> <a href="http://mytimewerks.com/">excellent</a> <a href="http://www.busymac.com/">clients</a>. This week in particular saw the release of my latest client-project, <a href="http://www.busymac.com/busytodo/index.html">BusyToDo</a> as a universal app for iPhone and iPad, right on the heels of my one year anniversary as an indie. I've been proud of the work I've done for all of my clients this year, but this latest release of BusyToDo has been a particularly satisfying achievement.</p>
<p>I count myself as extremely blessed to be doing what I do for a living. Not only do I make ends meet doing work I love, but I also have tremendous time flexibility. This makes it so much easier to do the little things like pack a lunch for my daughter and walk her to school each day. That is something I can't put a price on.</p>
<p>The other thing that "going indie" has allowed me to do is take up the drums. I've played guitar for about twenty-five years, but always harbored a secret desire to play the drums. When I was a kid I knew there was no way my parents were going to buy me a drumset (though why they put up with electric guitar is beyond me). As someone in their late thirties whose brain is starting to calcify, taking up something like drumming is a major mind-stretch. It has been, at times, one of the most frustrating things I've ever done. But it's also been one of the most rewarding.</p>
<p>When I get a new exercise or groove from my drum teacher, at the beginning of the week it seems impossible. How am I possibly going to get all these uncoordinated limbs to cooperate? Like any daunting problem, I break it down. I set the metronome to a laughably slow tempo and <em>slowly</em> work my way up. At the end of the week I (usually) get it. At an age when most people spend their days executing what they're experts at, it's easy to forget what the joy of mastery still feels like. Every day I thank my lucky stars that I have the opportunity to remember what that's like.</p>
