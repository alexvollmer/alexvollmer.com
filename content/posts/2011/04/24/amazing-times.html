<p>I know it sounds trite. But truly…we live in amazing times. If my fifteen year-old self could see the things I have available to me today, his little pubescent mind would have been completely blown off of his shoulders. Take an app like <a href="http://www.supermegaultragroovy.com/products/Capo/">Capo</a>, for instance. Here's something that lets me take any song out of my library, slow it down, fuss with the pitch to pick apart a song and learn how to play it. This technology was unthinkable twenty years ago when I first picked up the guitar. I had to rely on transcriptions in guitar magazines. I don't know what kind of gear the transcribers of the day were using, but I'm sure it was giant, immobile and expensive.</p>
<p>The best we could do were some ham-fisted tricks to try to slow-down turn-tables, but you could never really get it down to a reasonable pitch to match your guitar. So the secrets to our favorite songs were passed around amongst aspiring musicians like epic poems among ancient Greeks. This fits in my pocket. If I had seen that when I was fifteen it would have <em>melted my brain.</em></p>
<p>Or take a look at MLB.tv. I've been a huge baseball fan since I was thirteen. If you told me then that I would one day have a device I could sit in bed with, watch any ballgame I wanted to and look at realtime, in-game statistics, my unhinged jaw would never return to its rightful closed position.</p>
<p>Or the Kindle (device and app). I could read a book on my phone while waiting for the bus, then pickup right where I left off on my iPad for night-time reading before bed. That…is…simply…amazing.</p>
<p>So with all of our cool toys and services, are we really getting anywhere? By offloading the tedious and mundane tasks of modern living to technology, are we really taking advantage of our spare mental capacity? Are we really evolving as a culture or species to do more and learn more than our ancestors before us? I don't know. Sometimes I look at something like Farmville and I have to just shake my head at the frivolity of it all (money-making frivolity, but c'mon, are you kidding me?) On the other hand the role of social networks  in the Jasmine Revolution in the Middle East is heartening.</p>
<p>We live in a time breathtaking technical accomplishment. Each of us has the capability to achieve amazing things. We also have the equal opportunity to fritter our time and attention away on the trivial. So the question is, now that we can do so much, what are we going to do that's worthwhile?</p>
