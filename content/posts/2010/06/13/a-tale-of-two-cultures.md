I just returned from the 2010 edition of Apple's WWDC. The week before I took
a week off from my iPhone and lived with an Android Nexus One. Both my personal
experience with Android and the following week's announcements left a
strong impression that, in the so-called "smartphone" space, we are really
seeing the success of two very different mind-sets, cultures and philosophies.
I'm not interested in a winner-takes-all kind of war. Instead I wanted to look
at the differences between these two companies in the context of them 
co-existing and each having a happy, satisfied base of customers.

I *was* going to write about how capable the Nexus One seems to me, but how
amateurish the UI appears. At times, the look and feel of the Android UI
looks like its designers simply couldn't figure out how to fill the space
with something interesting.

I *was* going to write about how the ubiquity of the four hardware buttons are
both a blessing and curse. I understand that the designers were trying to
provide a set of near-universal options in a consistent place. Unfortunately
it was too easy to accidentally hit the "home" key while typing on the soft
keyboard.

I *was* going to write about the moment I realized just how different the
design philosophies between Android and iOS (nee iPhoneOS) are when I wanted
Instapaper integration with a good Twitter client. I needed to find an
Instapaper app, not a Twitter app with Instapaper integration. I simply didn't
grok the universal plugin architecture of Android at first. In hindsight it
makes perfect sense&mdash;if you're a software developer or tech-geek. It
seems insane to require the user to have a mental model that's so intimate
with Android's implementation details.

I *was* going to write about how delighted I was with Android's GMail
integration and how much I wish something similar existed on the iPhone. I
love GMail. I couldn't care less about other mail configurations (POP or
IMAP). Maybe the built-in regular mail app is as clunky as Apple's, but I
didn't use it. Kudos to Google for such a seamless integration with not only
Gmail, but the calendar and contacts too.

I *was* going to write about all these little bits of evidence that showed
just how different the philosophies are between these two companies and
these two platforms. I was going to write about how it's a bit odd to put
them in competition with each other because, in a sense, they are really
trying to build two different things: Google wants to build the most bad-ass
feature-rich, piece of mobile technology there ever was. Apple wants to build
a mobile experience.

I *was* going to write about all of these things, but after attending the
keynote at WWDC last week, I realized that there was only one thing that I
needed to point to that most effectively highlights the differences
between the two:

At the end of this video, you had a room full of five-thousand geeks drying
their eyes. You can call the video cheesy or manipulative. You can call it a
piece of marketing fluff. But that video was *not* about protocols,
compatibility, specifications or any of the myriad technical details we debate
on a daily basis. That video was about telling human stories that we can all
relate to.

I haven't yet been to a Google I/O event. I'd really like to attend one. But
right, wrong or indifferent, you would never see something like this from
Google. I can't think of anything that does a better job of summing up the
completely different views that Google and Apple have of the world.
