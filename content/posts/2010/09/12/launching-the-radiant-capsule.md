A while back [I posted](http://alexvollmer.com/posts/2010/04/17/thanks-mom/ "Alex Vollmer &mdash; Thanks, mom") 
about a significant career-change brought about by the
untimely death of my mom. This ultimately resulted in the formation
of my own one-man company, [Radiant Capsule](http://www.radiantcapsule.com/ "Radiant Capsule LLC&mdash;Mobile. Web. People.").
I used to find the idea of forming a company pretty daunting&mdash;all the
paperwork, all the tax-filing dates and whatnot to remember. It was all pretty
overwhelming. But since I've launched headlong into settling my mom's estate,
the effort forming an LLC seemed trivial by comparison.

So what's with the name? Kinda weird, isn't it? I went around and around on
various names. Eventually I settled on something related to space. I really love
the look and design of Stanley Kubrick's *2001: A Space Odyssey*. Not so much
for how it looks retro from our modern perspective, but how futuristic it
looked from 1969. I settled on having the word "capsule" in the name somewhere
because I liked the idea of a self-contained package. Right now it's just me,
but even if I ever bring on partners, I don't expect it to be too big. So
"space station" would have been inappropriate given the philosophy behind the
company.

Why "radiant"?. Rhythmically, I knew I wanted a name in the form of 
"*insert-adjective-here* Capsule". I sat down one afternoon, in complete
silence, and just wrote adjective after adjective on a sheet of paper. Just
trying out words I liked, and listening to how they sounded together. Finally
I hit upon "Radiant Capsule" and I felt like I had a winner. I just really
like the way it sounds.

The design was bootstrapped by the logo which was created by 
[Ryan Schroeder](http://whole-studios.com/ "Ryan Eilers Schroeder | Graphic &amp; UX Design").
After that I was off and running. I don't know whether you can call the
site design and business cards "good", but it is certainly some of the best
visual design I've ever done. Like all of this, it's a learning experience.
