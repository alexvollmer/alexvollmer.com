In the world of software we don't often think about the movement of our
bodies. Oh we argue about Dvorak keyboards and such, but we don't really
think about the intricate movements we require of our bodies. In other words,
we argue about mechanics but we don't really understand _motion_.

In the documentary 
["Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage"](http://www.rushbeyondthelightedstage.com/)
there's a great scene where Neil Peart is sitting down with the jazz legend
Freddie Gruber. In the interview they talk about the first time the two drum
masters met. They didn't play a note, but instead focused on the dance-like
motion of percussion. This was an epiphany for Mr. Peart, who is considered by
many to be *the* pre-eminent rock drummer of all time. Imagine being at the top
of your game for nearly forty years and suddenly having a whole new way to look
at your art! Instead of considering drumming to be the placement of notes in
time, Gruber thought of drumming as a rhythmic movement of the body that
happens to coincide with what we call "music".

I bring this up because I too, am going through a muscle-memory epiphany. I've
decided to try vim as my main text editor. I've spent a lot of years with Emacs
and the last few with TextMate. There are things I love about both, but neither
is perfect. I've worked with lots of smart people who swear by vim, so why not
try it out and see what it's all about?

I've always abhorred the silly "holy-wars" between Emacs and vim. It's the
worst kind of provincial rah-rah-ism in a world where perspective and decent
manners are few and far between<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup>. I am not "switching sides" because, frankly,
I was never on a particular "side" to begin with. These are simply
tools&mdash;nothing more.

Here's the funny thing: I've noticed that those that trumpet one over the
other often have no experience with the alternative. I can think of maybe one
or two other developers I know that have truly attempted to become experts
with both editors. Everyone else is simply guessing about "the other side".
For a profession that espouses hard data and facts, it's amazing how heated
the debates can be when each side has so little information about the other. 

But I digress&hellip;

## The Big Question ##

So it got me to thinking. Why is that so few people have tried to master both?
Is it _really_ impossible to learn a whole new set of keyboard motions once
you've mastered another?

I often joke with people that the one "super-power" I have as a developer is
my ability to remember hot-key combinations. When I code in Xcode I know all
the hot-keys to make it sing. When I'm writing in TextMate I know how to make
it go. I don't consciously execute keyboard motions, they are just part of the
development experience with that tool.

The reason I joke about it is because I don't really think that it's all that
extraordinary. It's true that it's not something I see in a lot of other
developers, but I don't believe it's because they can't do it. I think it's
because they've never learned how to learn motion.

## Six Strings and the Truth ##

Looking back, I've realized that the greatest learning experience I ever had
was learning to play the guitar. I started when I was 14 and I was
deadly-serious about it from day one. I devoured everything I could find on the
subject. I learned music theory, practiced all manner of finger exercises and
played and played and played.<sup><a href="#note2">2</a></sup> As a result,
I'm a pretty good rock guitar player.

The funny side-effect of this experience is that I taught myself how to learn.
I can still remember learning basic music-theory on a train ride when I was a
teenager. It just hit me like ton of bricks. It was all so simple. After that,
the mystery of A&#x266D;7&#x266F;5 was gone. It was obvious what that chord was and what it
sounded like.

Not only did I learn how to learn in a strictly academic sense (you should see
the binders full of notes I've kept over the years), but I also learned how to
teach my fingers to learn. As a result keyboard shortcuts are pretty easy to
master. It's like learning another song. Nobody agonizes over having to
remember each and every finger-movement to play a new tune. You practice it,
play it a few times, see the patterns in it and then it's just _there_. You
don't think about it. Why should mastering another editor be any different?

## Brain Stretching ##

I'm fascinated with the learning process. I've made it a point in my career to
make learning a continous process. I simply do not get people who do the same
thing for years on end. How do they not go insane? 

So I'm always looking for ways to stretch myself. This year I'm extending my
learning more broadly and decided to start taking drum lessons.  Wow. Wanna
feel awkward in less then two seconds? Try playing the simplest syncopation
beat requiring independent movement from your limbs. It's a humbling
experience. But, man, I can't wait to figure it out!

## Circling Back ##

So what does this have to with editors? Honestly, I'm not quite sure yet. But
I think most developers have a pretty narrow view of what they're willing to
learn. As often as not, I think folks just stick with whatever they happened
to stumble upon the first time. Think about it. How many things are central to
your game that are the result of circumstances? Are you an Emacs master just
because of that one job you had with that one graybeard who taught you all of
the tricks? How would your career have turned out if you _hadn't_ met that
guy?

It's not just about editors either. You see it in every dude who lives and dies
with a single programming language or platform. I've got my favorites too, but
they've never been eternal. I can't help but think that such a narrow view
contributes in some way to the mountains of terrible software out there in the
world. How could anyone possibly build anything of quality with such a small
view of the world?

So I don't think I'll be practicing my vim with a metronome the way I practice
stick-control exercises or the way I mastered the harmonic minor scale.
Instead we practice these motions in our daily development work as a matter of
course. The fact that our livelihoods are tied to this activity I think makes
people hesitant to totally re-jigger their game. I get that. But I also think
it's not as scary as it sounds (I seem to do this in some way every two years
or so) and it gives you a much broader view of the world.

So Emacs-dudes? Listen up. C-x C-c outta that sucker and try something else.
You snotty vim dudes? Hit <code>:q</code> and try life on the other side. You
may still hate it, but don't ever pretend that you couldn't get better by
learning something radically different.

    Seriously. There are times when I'm just embarassed to call myself a
    software developer. How did we all become so incredibly socially inept?

    At one point in college, I wrote a program (in Scheme!) that generated
    random chord combinations (e.g. Am7, C&#x266F;maj7, etc. etc.) I taught
    myself to to go from one voicing to another with the least amount of
    fretboard movement. Eventually I extended this to practicing arpeggios too.
    It was like a little game and it was fun to get better and better at it.
