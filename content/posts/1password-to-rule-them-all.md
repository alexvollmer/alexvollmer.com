I came across a fantastic piece of Mac software thanks to a [Merlin Mann tweet](http://twitter.com/hotdogsladies). The app is called [1Password](http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password) and, to paraphrase Mr. Mann's original tweet, it solves a problem I didn't even realize I had. Well...that's not entirely true. I knew that the various passwords I have scattered across the net weren't as secure as they could be. I had heard of master-password apps but hadn't really done much research on them. Now I'm not going to bother because 1Password so completely blew me away that I went ahead and bought the license (more on that in a bit).

As you might suspect, 1Password is a master-password application. You can easily generate hard-to-crack passwords (like, '81239jsdfj912jlksdf8981'), but only have to remember one master-password. This in and of itself isn't particularly interesting (though the password-generation feature is really well done). What makes 1Password so compelling is how well it is integrated into your online activities. 1Password works with just about every kind of web browser you can imagine on a Mac.

On Firefox, 1Password can install a toolbar that puts all of 1Password's features right there. When you navigate to a site for which you stored a password, you can automatically fill out a form with the click of a button. If you haven't re-authorized with 1Password in a bit (often after waking up my laptop) you have to give your master password again (nice touch boys).

Also whenever you submit a page that 1Password thinks is auth-related, it will offer to remember these credentials for you. When you update your credentials on a site, the app will ask if you want to update your existing credentials. That is absolutely killer. Clearly these guys understand the achilles' heel to most security systems--people are lazy and are the weakest link. Having such smooth, inline integration makes it difficult for even the lazy user to subvert their own security.

1Password doesn't just live in your browser, it's also a nice stand-alone application. You can easily modify and update your secure information as well as import and export it (a handy way for me to sync my work and home machines).

You're not just limited to passwords either. The app also comes with a notion of identities where you can specify the contact information you might need at various web sites. For myself, I keep both "work" and "personal" profiles. Whenever I have to sign up for something I can simply click the profile I want to use and 1Password fills out as many of the relevant form fields as it can. It also has a "wallet" feature where you can stuff various other secure information like credit card numbers (including the verification number on the back), AWS keys and host of other things. Very very very cool.

Perhaps the most supremely cool feature of 1Password is the ability to sync encrypted javascript bookmarklets with your iPhone that gives you access to those same secret items on your iPhone! 1Password creates two special bookmarklets (synced via iTunes through your Safari bookmarks). One displays your passwords, the other will fill out web forms with with the selected credentials. Both require you to enter a password to unlock the bookmarklet, which you set when you export the bookmarklets from the application. Being able to get that secure information away from my computer makes sure that I don't set simple passwords for iPhone access just because I can't get to my secret stuff. Well done, boys, well done.

The features of this app alone are enough to have sold me. But a good part of the impression this tool has made is how nicely it's been done: no sharp corners, wonderful usability, smooth integration. Even the experience of entering the license key is cool. Your license is an image file (no doubt with some extra steganographic goodies embedded) that you simply drag to a target area. No funny numbers to type. How freakin' cool is that?

I've got a whole 'nuther post cooking up about my master-list of indispensable nerd-tools, but I felt that this app was worth a standalone post. If you're on a Mac, do yourself a favor and check this app out.

P.S. No, I wasn't paid a dime to write this.
