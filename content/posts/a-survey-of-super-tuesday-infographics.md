  :body: The TV Coverage was much worse!  CNN guy had Google maps laid over and would zoom in for no apparent reason and run out of meaningless chatter and zoom out again!

    How about the Globe &amp; Mail?

    In particular, their Delegate Tracker:

    I really liked their approach, but I'd be interested to see what you think.

    I had the same frustration of finding a good delegate tracker. This one from Associated Press has some very nice features:

  :body: Nice post. The only thing that bugged me about most of the coverage is that they covered SuperTuesday only. If you wanted to figure out how the candidates are doing in the race as a whole, it was difficult.

    @alex: infographics is a large emerging trend, which combines contemporary minimalism with  the current need for knowledge. if you ever read trend reports, you will understand. the draw is much like how there is competition to optimize code better than others - in the same way, increasing the amount of information being passed per space allotted.
    
    @article: keep in mind that your criteria for information might be different than what the general public needs. the target consumer is drastically different for each of the papers and is designed to cater to such an audience. while many of your criticisms are valid, i feel you may be overlooking the purpose of the visual graphics. the overall gist can be conveyed much accurately through the geographic data without having to hyper-analyze the text - a simple table will not do. though most of the country may know the shape of each state, keep in mind there is a large influx of immigrants and lesser educated of citizens who also have the same right to vote. personally, my ideal chart for super tuesday would include the map, but have more information succinctly displayed in each individual state. well-executed mouse-overs and zooming would increase negative space to minimize cluttering (which was overly apparent in the Washington Post map). Great article and I did find this an interesting read.

    I just wanted to make one more clarification about the map displays. I'm not inherently against maps, but in this case I felt that they didn't present enough information to justify the visual space they occupied.
    
    Having a visualization of how candidates do across various regions <i>would</i> be interesting, but in the case of Super Tuesday not all states were participating leaving a number of the state without <i>any</i> relevant information.
    
    For the November elections a map may well be a good visualization of how candidates did. I would simply add that I would prefer the mouse-navigation element be removed and the detail information be indicated directly within the state image. Clearly that's not an easy task, but I guess that what separates great graphics from mediocre ones.

    Great post. Saved me from having to do the same (though I already collected all the proper screenshots!).
    
    Very much agree with your assessment. I see you did yourself a favor and didn't look at Fox News. :)

    Cool blog post. I'm going to share this one around.
    
    One note on your comment about the CNN map:  The northern border of the United States *IS* a fairly straight line -- as well as many of the state borders -- if looked at by longitude and latitude. The problem is that it is on curved surface (the Earth) which you can't draw on a flat piece of paper. To get around that maps are drawn with different kinds of "projections" to minimize distortions. So you usually see a projection of the United States which curves the northern border but there are other projections -- such as the one CNN used -- which stay true to the borders. So CNN's map is not wrong. Just different.

    Apparently you missed much of the NY Times content, especially re: the map. If you click on a state, you get a detailed county view of that state, and can mouse over it county-by-county to see margins in cities, rural areas, etc.
    
    It's a Very powerful statistical graphics display. Maybe doesn't fit Your criteria, but it allows one to bore down into the data and learn a lot about who's voting for who.
    
    Further, within that same display, you can click Full State Results and get a detailed tabular presentation.
    
    As someone who was involved in development of Geographic Information Systems from their early days on, I found it by Far the most useful and compelling set of tools that night.

  :body: A great review Alex.. I watched 3 hours of CNN with a typesetter and motion graphics whiz and we picked apart their coverage.. I agree it is/was incredibly flawed. The whiz-bang factor of that touch display was completely overridden by their horrible overall graphic strategy. Ironically, their web presence was concise and clear in comparison - a scary thought.

    I had no idea people would find this so interesting. I love all the comments and it tickles me that folks care to read about.
    
    I wanted to reply to a couple of folks (including Charles Apple) who pointed out that the northern border of the US (as well as some state borders) are in fact flat lines, but that maps using conic projection give us the illusion of curvature.
    
    These are all fair points and I should have been more clear on why I thought this was useless. I think if CNN had a policy of "righting our view" of geography by abandoning conic projection, that would be one thing. However IMHO this "flat-view" of the US was done for style more than anything else. My criticism of all the geographic displays holds for the CNN , and it gets extra bad marks for being--in my view--overly stylized despite whatever geographic principles may back it.

    I enjoyed this rundown but I'm curious as to why you are so absolutely against the visualization of states simply due to "thinness" of data or space occupied (unless you are viewing on a tiny screen). In some cases, the map provides a cleaner interface to select states. In my mind, I group by region, not alphabetical order. That being said, if I need to digest the numbers quickly, nothing is going to beat a list. It depends on what you're looking for.
     
    And I'm not saying it's easy to create a graphical version. You can see my (amateur) attempt at a <a href="http://blog.smartdraw.com/archive/2008/01/21/2008-us-primary-elections.aspx" title="my amateur electoral map" rel="nofollow"> primary electoral map</a>. At least I only spent a few hours on mine.

On Super Tuesday, I forwent attending the usual Seattle Ruby Brigade meeting and stayed at home glued to the radio and TV keeping up on the primary and caucus results across the nation. I love the Public Radio/TV talking heads, but I was really lacking the overall picture. So I warmed up the Internet tubes and started searching for some helpful at-a-glance snapshot of the state of Super Tuesday.

Here then, is an amateur's critique of the various infographics I tripped across. What I was looking for was something that would tell me:
*  Margin of victory for each candidate
*  Percentage of precincts reporting
*  The number of delegates available
*  The number of delegates each candidate won
*  Clear indication of races that have finished, and those that have not.
*  I want as much information as I can get in a small space
*  I don't want to navigate through data

## The New York Times
So let's start with New York Times. This tabular graphic came from the New York Times front page:

![Picture 2.png](/uploads/2008/02/picture-2.png)

This one came the closest to the goals I was looking for. The Times doesn't waste any space on images of either the candidates or the states themselves (something a lot of other graphics couldn't avoid). I get just about everything I'm looking for on my list, except for the delegates.

From the front page, I followed the "Full Coverage" link to this pictorial table which shows the breakdown by state. The conversion of images to black and white for candidates that have dropped out is a nice visual touch. I don't mind this too much because the table would still be quite readable without them. This table is essentially the same information as the previous one, except that it shows all of the states and has the additional bonus of indicating states whose primaries haven't happened yet.

![Picture 3.png](/uploads/2008/02/picture-3.png)

And then, of course, we have the ubiquitous geographic map. This view was predominant one across most of these sites. Many sites touted these things as "interactive" which amazes me that it could be considered a possible selling point. I'll take "informative" over "interactive" any day of the week thank you.

![200802052027.jpg](/uploads/2008/02/200802052027.jpg)
## The Washington Post
This little tidbit was at the bottom of each party's news column on the [Washington Post Politics page](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/politics/index.html). I'm not so hot on the geographic map, but the fact that it was placed at the bottom of a text column instead dominating the page (as many of the maps do) earns this a few points.

![Picture 5.png](/uploads/2008/02/picture-5.png)

Next, we turn to the Post's "Super Map", which is a glut of hyperactive mouse-oriented popups. It looks promising, but the popup comments came up too easily and weren't easily dismissed. While this map gives us some notion of the delegates each state has, I can't tell which candidate got what portion of delegates. Also states that have declared winners don't show any margin of victory details. This map takes up the entire screen and doesn't really earn the space it takes up.

![200802052031.jpg](/uploads/2008/02/200802052031.jpg)

At the bottom of the map was a little trend-line chart for the Democrats. Care to guess when Edwards dropped out of the race?

![200802052031.jpg](/uploads/2008/02/2008020520311.jpg)
## National Public Radio
This is the table from the front page of National Public Radio's page. This table gives me most of the things I'm looking for with no space wasted on unnecessary graphics. While we get delegate information, the lack of percentages is unfortunate. This is the only tabular display I found that ordered the per-state results in the chronological order in which the polls will close.

![Picture 7.png](/uploads/2008/02/picture-7.png)

This table was a nice compact little sidebar on NPR's Super Tuesday coverage page. This is probably the best delegate information I found out of any of the sites surveyed here.

![Picture 8.png](/uploads/2008/02/picture-8.png)
*CNN*

I have to come clean and admit that I simply can't stand CNN. It's always on and has so little useful content. The election coverage I've seen to-date has some of the glitziest, lowest-density graphics in their live broadcasts of any I've seen. The touch displays are merely a cover up for the fact that the content is empty and newscasters cannot improv. However, I have to give CNN credit with this tabular display. Not fantastic, but at least no wasted space on graphics.

![Picture 9.png](/uploads/2008/02/picture-9.png)

However, this table falls short on a number of counts. The biggest problem is the need to paginate through results. Requiring mouse-overs to get popups on a map is one thing, but clicking through a list of data to find what you're looking for is simply inexcusable. This is a particularly obnoxious example of failing to making the data dense enough.

From the "Full Coverage" link:

![Picture 10.png](/uploads/2008/02/picture-10.png)

I find the stylized map insulting. The northern border of the United States is not a flat. The state borders don't line up neatly in rows. Not only does this map have the same faults of the others (low data density, too much interaction required), it's also simply wrong.
## USA Today
The USA Today made it's name in glitzy, over-wrought graphics and typing the URL in the browser bar I fully expected some useless 3D pie-charts and other such non-sense. I was pleasantly surprised to find this box on the front page:

![Picture 11.png](/uploads/2008/02/picture-11.png)

This is a surprisingly informative view. The densely-packed links dispense with state navigation via map. I don't mind navigation here so much because I can quickly get to any state. I don't have paginate through results and I don't have to float over states whose shapes I can't remember to find them. Instead, clicking on a well-known state abbreviation link in the navigation bar gives you a nice detailed breakdown:

![Picture 12.png](/uploads/2008/02/picture-12.png)

The inclusion of the advertisement in the outlined space of the first graphic works to draw your attention, but is really a turn-off. It's only because I was giving each site one click that I continued navigating through the site. Normally, I would have left the site for that reason. To be fair, I understand the these sites have to support themselves with advertising. But putting an ad in the middle of a graphic depicting who we pick as our president in one of the most critical times of our history really cheapens the subject being covered.
## MSNBC
Sigh...

![Picture 13.png](/uploads/2008/02/picture-13.png)

By now you've probably figured out that I think the inclusion of visual geographic information is superfluous. The state images take a third of each state's space for information. Other than the letter and color, which indicate the candidate and party, this space doesn't help me. I can tell that the box is about California because it is titled "California" at the top. The inclusion of state images seems like a weak attempt to "spice up" the presentation of the data.

This graphic gives us the usual percentages, including the percentage of precincts reporting, and the total delegates which is helpful. However, since each state apportions delegates differently, we can't really tell how important a margin of victory is in a particular state. I can't really harp on MSNBC for this, nobody included that level of detail in the graphic summaries.
