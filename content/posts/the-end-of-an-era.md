  :body: Please, please post your Eclipse Fu online. I need a place in the cloud to get it from. My super powers do not include memorizing key combinations (they do, however, include the ability to make annoying noises and a propensity for bowel issues at high altitude, but I suspect _that_ was TMI)

Well, okay maybe that title is a bit misleading. I mean, we're not talking about a transition from when dinosaurs ruled the earth to the Ice Age or the introduction of the combustible engine. But today I shut down my remaining home Linux server which ran this blog since its inception.

After overcoming a few technical hurdles I got this blog moved over to Dreamhost. Things seem to be running well, but if you notice anything, let me know.

It sort of felt like the end of "T2" when Arnie willingly destroys himself in the forgery and signals a final thumbs-up before incineration. It was definitely time for that box to shutdown, but just a tiny bit sad just the same.
