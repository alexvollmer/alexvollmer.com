You like command-line parsing, but you hate all of the bloat. Why
should you have to create a Hash, then create a parser, fill the Hash
out then throw the parser away (unless you want to print out a usage
message) and deal with a Hash? Why, for Pete's sake, should the parser
and the parsed values be handled by two different objects?

Changes:

### 1.0.2 / 2009-10-02

* Merged patches from Adam Salter:
  * Added new "presence" method for options.
  * Updated rspec usage to match the latest & greatest syntax
  * Make descriptions optional for flags and options

* <http://clip.rubyforge.org>
