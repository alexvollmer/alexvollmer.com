I'm pleased to announce the release of the first in a series of [PeepCode screencasts for the iPhone SDK](http://peepcode.com) I've been co-writing with Geoffrey Grosenbach. The first one (done in two parts) covers View Controller basics. We decided to start with View Controllers because they are at the core of all "productivity"-style applications. Once you have them down, you can start to put some meat on the bones of your iPhone apps.

Once we've covered those, we'll work our way through the entire MVC Holy Trinity, one bit at a time. Along the way we hope to deep-dive on a few ancillary topics like Core Location, Game Kit as well as provisioning and unit-testing. We also hope to look at visual technologies like Core Graphics and Core Animation, as well model-related APIs like Core Data and web service-related libraries.

The iPhone SDK is huge and there's a ton of material out there to cover. We're very excited to kick off what we hope will be a useful and successful instructional series for perspective iPhone developers out there. Let us know what you want to see.
