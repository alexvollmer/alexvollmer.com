You like command-line parsing, but you hate all of the bloat. Why
should you have to create a Hash, then create a parser, fill the Hash
out then throw the parser away (unless you want to print out a usage
message) and deal with a Hash? Why, for Pete's sake, should the parser
and the parsed values be handled by two different objects?

Changes:

=== 0.0.4 / 2008-06-06

* Fixed typo in error message (thanks francois!)

=== 0.0.3 / 2008-06-05

* Merged technomancy's patches for simple 1 LOC parsing -> hash
