This is all I walked out of the local Apple Store with today. No unnecessary bag. No receipt I have to dispose of securely. Just the product I wanted and a friendly little "Thank you" sticker. If all stores were like this, I might actually like to shop.

The local Apple Store also switched over to a cool new portable POS system where just about any sales associate can swipe your credit-card and allow you to make the purchase there. They must have been paying attention to customer complaints because before the remodel, the lines to the cash register were absolute heinous.

This was fantastic. I walked in, a sales associated asked what I was looking for. I told her and she immediately directed me to the available products. I picked one and she took to me another guy who had one of these little POS thingies. I gave him my card, he asked if I wanted my receipt e-mailed to me and I was out the door in less than two minutes. In the time it took my wife to pick out a wedding present I walked a block to the Apple Store, completed this transaction and made it back to where she was before she was ready to go. Fantastic.
