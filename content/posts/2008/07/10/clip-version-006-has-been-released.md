You like command-line parsing, but you hate all of the bloat. Why
should you have to create a Hash, then create a parser, fill the Hash
out then throw the parser away (unless you want to print out a usage
message) and deal with a Hash? Why, for Pete's sake, should the parser
and the parsed values be handled by two different objects?

Changes:

0.0.6 / 2008-07-10

* Fixed a bug with getting the 'remainder' when only flags are declared.

* <http://clip.rubyforge.org>
