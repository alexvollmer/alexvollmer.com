Tonight's post-get-the-kid-to-bed hacking time was a mad dash to cleanup a handful of bugs that some of you fine folks found with [moochbot](http://moochbot.com). In no particular order is a list of this evening's "a-ha" moments:

*  Receiving email works much much better when you configure your MX records correctly
*  Mixing ERb and HAML is a really really bad idea
*  I'm probably using RubyGems in my Rails app in about the stupidest way possible
*  Good dynamic form validation with JavaScript is actually quite tricky
*  Squashing commits in Git is still pretty damn cool.

That's all for now. Good night and good luck.
