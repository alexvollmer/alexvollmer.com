The secret side-project that I've been referring to in various posts finally reached its Version One milestone tonight. I closed out the remaining V1 issues off of my to-do list and suddenly realized that I could turn it loose on the world. So, without further ado, I present to you: [moochbot](http://moochbot.com moochbot — track what you lend and borrow) . Check it out and see what I've been up to all this time.

I'd love to hear any feedback folks have; what you love and what you hate. I have a ton of V2 features planned so moochbot will certainly continue to evolve. It's running on a single Slicehost slice so it's not real high-powered. Your patience is appreciated.

I'll have plenty of blog-material from this experience to write up later, but for now I'm just going to enjoy the satisfying feeling of getting something done. Enjoy!
